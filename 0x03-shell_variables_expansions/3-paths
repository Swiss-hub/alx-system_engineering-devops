#!/bin/bash
echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep -c .
# This script counts the number of directories in the PATH variable.
# It does this by replacing the colons with newlines and counting the resulting lines.
# The output is the number of directories in the PATH variable.
# The script uses the `tr` command to translate colons to newlines and then uses `grep -c .` to count non-empty lines.
# Usage: ./3-paths
# Output: The number of directories in the PATH variable.
# Example output: 4
# Note: The output may vary depending on the user's PATH variable.
